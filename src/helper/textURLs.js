    'AI already playing bigger roles behind the scenes in healthcare: Kenneth Mak. SINGAPORE - Artificial intelligence (AI) is emerging as a game changer in healthcare, bringing about a significant shift in the way diseases are detected, thereby providing for early interventions and hopefully better outcomes.Such AI-supported augmented detection of abnormalities in chest X-rays, mammograms and CT scans of the brain is on the cusp of moving from a pilot phase to being used at scale and becoming mainstream, said Professor Kenneth Mak, director-general of health at the Ministry of Health (MOH).“Most people are not aware that actually AI is already part of our normal conversations because a lot of the applications are behind the scenes, under the surface; but already (it) has a big and significant influence in how we deliver care at the population level, not necessarily to the individual level,” said Prof Mak, who was speaking at a panel discussion on the opening day of the inaugural International Conference on Artificial Intelligence in Medicine 2023.Organised by Nanyang Technological University’s Lee Kong Chian School of Medicine (LKCMedicine) and College of Engineering, and the National Healthcare Group, the three-day conference aims to foster collaboration across disciplines and discuss the implications of AI in healthcare. The conference kicked off on Saturday and was held at NTU LKCMedicine in Mandalay Road. The conference expects to have about 600 attendees including clinicians, researchers, scientists, engineers, AI experts, tech innovators, policymakers and students to explore the transformative effects of AI on healthcare. Joining Prof Mak at the panel discussion – titled Will AI affect the lives and jobs of medical professionals? – were Dr Tan See Leng, the guest of honour and Manpower Minister and Second Minister for Trade and Industry; Prof Miao Chun Yan, chair of NTU’s School of Computer Science and Engineering; and Dr Zhou Lihan, co-founder and chief executive of MiRXES, a Singapore-based cancer diagnostics company.Giving an example of a paradigm shift occurring in polyclinics that manage many patients with diabetes who require regular eye screening, Prof Mak said the screenings were traditionally labour-intensive, requiring the meticulous manual interpretation of each retinal photograph. But this is changing with an AI-driven system, Selena+. Through machine learning and deep learning algorithms, Selena+ reads these digital retinal photographs, identifying diabetic damage to the eye with an impressive accuracy rate of over 95 to 97 per cent, he said. Long-term diabetes can cause serious injuries to the eye, even leading to vision loss if left unchecked. These accurate results are swiftly relayed back to the doctors, allowing them to act without much further processing. This has enabled clinics to save on manpower and specialist input. What started as a pilot is now mainstream across all clinics, added Prof Mak. He also noted the concerns over AI-driven applications, some of which relate to a lack of clarity around the medical and legal implications of allowing AI technology to take over roles and tasks from humans. Prof Mak noted that there have been mixed feelings towards AI technology among healthcare professionals, although attitudes have overall been positive. Some concerns have surfaced, however, over the lack of institutional policies to guide doctors, nurses and healthcare professionals, on how to deal with AI. “But I think this is really a positive evolution, because we’re struggling with evolution of technology and to some extent, sometimes it’s running ahead of the game. We often require some deliberate discussions about the ethics, the responsible use of data only to find that actually the technology is improving leaps and bounds beyond what we can do,” he said. Minister Tan, who is also a qualified medical practitioner, said it is important for the Government to set the framework and policies for AI to be adopted responsibly, but the industry may not have the luxury of adopting a wait-and-see approach, given that things are moving so quickly elsewhere. Dr Tan posited that AI could be a key advantage in the upstream monitoring of patients’ health, by helping to predict the onset of chronic conditions such as diabetes, hypertension and even cancer, which take years to develop but show early warning signs. Overlaid with one’s family history and genetics, a doctor could know with a high degree of certainty what ailments a patient is likely to have in five to 10 years, he said. But to make this work will require a mechanism to anonymise medical data, he added.',

    'No Ninja Turtle: Image of motorcyclist with stingray strapped to his back goes viral. SINGAPORE – No, this is not a promotion for the upcoming Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem movie, despite this rider looking like a hero in a half-shell. A viral image circulating online earlier this week of a motorcyclist with a stingray strapped to his back drew more than a few comparisons from online commenters to the beloved pizza-eating, wisecracking, anthropomorphic turtle superheroes we all know and love. A man was seen carrying the 25kg stingray like a backpack while on his motorbike at the intersection of Pasir Ris Industrial Drive 1, according to a report from Malay-language daily Berita Harian.In an interview with Berita Harian, the 36-year-old man said he had caught the stingray on the morning of July 22, along with two other broad cowtail rays weighing 19kg and 61kg. The stingrays were then reportedly divided between the man and his friends, before being further shared with members of his family and neighbours and cooked in a variety of dishes. While some might be tickled at the prospect of an unintentionally cartoonish Ninja Turtle cosplay, wildlife enthusiasts have urged local anglers to be more mindful when catching rays, as some species are classified as endangered in Singapore. The ray in the image, which went viral when it was uploaded last Tuesday, is likely to be either the critically endangered broad cowtail ray (Pastinachus ater) or cowtail ray (Pastinachus sephen), said a spokesman from conservation non-profit organisation Marine Stewards in response to queries from The Straits Times. The broad cowtail ray is classified as critically endangered in the Singapore Red Data Book and vulnerable by the International Union for Conservation of Nature’s (IUCN) Red List. The cowtail ray is listed as near threatened under IUCN, and is not listed in the Red Data Book.Species listed as vulnerable on the IUCN’s Red List are “considered to be facing a high risk of extinction in the wild”, while those that are critically endangered face an “extremely high risk of extinction in the wild”. The Singapore Red Data Book provides information such as the scientific and common names, IUCN global status, national conservation status and description of each plant and animal species. It uses the same evaluation metrics and references the international status, but also assigns a local status for the animal. “Generally, stingrays have low birth rates, and are susceptible to fishing pressure. “So, anglers can consider to release them,” said the Marine Stewards spokesman. In response to ST queries, Mr Ryan Lee, group director of the National Parks Board’s National Biodiversity Centre, urged members of the public to carry out recreational fishing responsibly. “This includes using sustainable fishing methods like catch-and-release fishing, where fish that are caught are released back into the sea,” he said. He added that stingrays play a key role in coastal and marine ecosystems, and noted that Singapore’s waters are home to a variety of them, including species like the broad cowtail ray. “(Stingrays) control prey populations by feeding on a variety of fish and crustaceans. The excavation of sand by stingrays that feed or burrow on the seafloor also helps create microhabitats for invertebrates,” said Mr Lee. In 2021, a video clip of an endangered eagle ray being reeled in at East Coast Park went viral, with multiple images and videos showing the ray being dragged along a jetty.',

    '‘Mr Tharman was the policymaker, I was the moneymaker’: Presidential hopeful Ng Kok Song. SINGAPORE – There is a “very big difference” between a chief information officer and a chief investment officer, said presidential hopeful Ng Kok Song, stressing that the latter is as important as, if not more important than, being the chief executive of an organisation. Mr Ng was responding to comments made by Mr George Goh, who is also running for president, at a press conference on Friday. Mr Goh had said that “if I’m the CIO of my organisation (then) please don’t come forward” to run for president, as the post ranks fifth or sixth, and is not the top job. Speaking to the media during a visit to Tiong Bahru Market on Saturday, Mr Ng, 75, a former chief investment officer at GIC, said: “I think Mr Goh made a mistake. He thinks that CIO is chief information officer. It is chief investment officer, you see, and that’s a very big difference.” He added: “I would like Mr Goh to hear from (investment management companies) Bridgewater and Pimco and similar organisations, the CIO is as important as, if not more important than, the CEO.” He added that he would like to meet Mr Goh for coffee “so that the two of us can sit down together and share our knowledge”.“I want to learn from Mr Goh his knowledge about business. I can learn from him, but I can also share with Mr Goh my knowledge about the investment business. Because he has not been in the investment business, but I spent 45 years in it,” he said. In a YouTube video released on Mr Goh’s channel on Friday, he said that Mr Ng and former senior minister Tharman Shanmugaratnam are “both from the same background”, having held posts at the Monetary Authority of Singapore and GIC. When asked, Mr Ng said he was at both organisations as a public service officer, not as a political leader or minister. He said that when he was the chief investment officer at GIC, he made recommendations to the board, which approves organisational and investment policies. “And when the policies are approved by the board, (which includes) Mr Tharman, I have to execute the policies. I have to make the policies work, the strategies work. “In other words, for investment management organisation, Mr Tharman was the policymaker; I was the moneymaker.” Mr Ng was accompanied by his fiancee Sybil Lau at the market on Saturday, where he spoke with stallholders and residents. Ms Lau, 45, sits on several boards, including SG Enable, a registered charity for persons with disabilities. Speaking to the media at Tiong Bahru Market, Mr Ng said the president plays an important role in protecting Singapore’s reserves, which helps to keep the Singapore dollar strong and blunt the rising cost of living. “The important thing is for the people of Singapore to know me… that I’m a human being that comes to the wet market. I’m a single parent, I come here to buy food for my family. I know about the cost of living, because I have experienced it,” he said. He added that he would like to reach out to young people to help them manage stress, such as by teaching them how to meditate. “When you meditate, you grow yourself, and then you discover who you really are. You don’t have to perform, you don’t have to conform. You are a unique human being. So, it’s very important for young people to have self-confidence.” Mr Ng also said he would encourage public speaking and communication in young people of all races. “Most of our Singaporeans are shy to speak in public. They know a lot of things (but they) must learn to communicate,” he said. “You don’t have to speak perfect English, but you can speak better. Because unless you can communicate, people do not know what your ideas are.”',
